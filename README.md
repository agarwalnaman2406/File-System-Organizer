# File-System-Organizer

This Project arranges the unorganized files within directory of a system.

for example when we download things such as of archives,media,documents,photos etc to the same location [directory] then everything gets messed up, which generally don't looks good in system. So for these , a program is written to manange each specific files to that particular folder..

Command for running the project

node main.js organize "dirpath" // organize the file into the directory

node main.js tree "dirpath" // makes the tree of the given directory

node main.js help // give all the command which is present for use.
